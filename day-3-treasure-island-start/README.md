# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Python

## Day 3: Treasure Hunt Adventure with If Statements

### Today's Learnings:

1. **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):**
   - Use `if` statements to execute code based on a condition.
   - Employ `elif` (else if) for additional conditions and `else` for a fallback option.

   ```python
   if condition:
       # Code to execute if the condition is True
   elif another_condition:
       # Code to execute if the first condition is False, and this one is True
   else:
       # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
    ```
2. Logical Operators:
    - Combine conditions using logical operators (and, or, not).

    ```python
    if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute if both conditions are True
    elif condition1 or condition2:
        # Code to execute if at least one condition is True
    else:
        # Code to execute if none of the conditions are True
    ```
