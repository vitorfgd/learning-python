# 100 Days of Code Challenge - Python

## Day 2: Tip Calculator Exercise

### Today's Learnings:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   - Learn about fundamental data types like integers, floats, and strings.
   - Example:

     ```python
     age = 25
     price = 10.5
     message = "Hello, World!"
     ```

2. **Number Manipulation:**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.
   - Example:

     ```python
     total = 5 + 3.2
     ```

3. **String Manipulation:**
   - Combine and manipulate text strings.
   - Example:

     ```python
     name = "John"
     greeting = "Hello, " + name
     ```

### Today's Exercise: Tip Calculator

Your task is to create a simple tip calculator. Use the knowledge gained about data types, number manipulation, and string manipulation to achieve the following:
- Take the total bill amount as input.
- Calculate the tip (15%, 18%, or 20% based on user choice).
- Print a message that includes the total bill, the tip amount, and the final amount.
